Up to age 18 the local council is responsible for supporting you and giving you enough money to live so you should contact your **Personal Adviser** in **Children's Services** 
[https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council)

If you can't get any help from Children's Services, contact one of the organisations listed below and tell someone that you aren't being supported by the council

If you are over 18 and unemployed but looking for a job, you should contact your local **Jobcentre Plus** and request that you are given Class 1 National Insurance contribution credits. This will build up your entitlement to claim benefits at a later date if you are not currently eligible
