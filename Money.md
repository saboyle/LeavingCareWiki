## Money

Up to age 18 the local council is responsible for supporting you and giving you enough money to live so you should contact your **Personal Adviser** in **Children's Services**

You should contact your local **Jobcentre Plus** to find out what benefits are available to you. If you are 16 or over you are entitled to apply for **Jobseeker’s Allowance** because you are a care leaver. Make sure you tell them that you are a care leaver to make sure you get everything you are entitled to

You might be told you have to apply for **Universal Credit** instead of Jobseeker’s Allowance
