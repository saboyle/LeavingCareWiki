## Housing

The person who looks after you in the local council, your **Personal Adviser**, must tell you what is available for you to move to when you leave care. Ask them what you are entitled to in the way of  'Setting Up Home Allowances' also known as '**Leaving Care Grants**'

The housing charity **Shelter** has a website with useful information about what you are entitled to

If you are moved to a place where you don’t feel safe for any reason then tell the person who looks after you in the council. If they don’t help you then contact one of these organisations that help young people stand up for their rights

## Are you Homeless?

Contact your **Personal Adviser** at **Children's Services** who should treat you as what they call a ‘child in need’ of emergency accommodation. If you don’t get support from the council these sites can help:

Find homeless accommodation near you by going to **Google Maps** and typing your town into the search and then 'homeless shelter'. The nearest places are then listed.
